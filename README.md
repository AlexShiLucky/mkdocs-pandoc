# DESCRIPTION

This is a mixed bag of preprocessors for mkdocs style markdown that will
convert it into one markdown file suitable for consumption by `pandoc(1)`.
Their original purpose is providing a path for generating PDF and EPUB output
in a sane manner, i.e. without having to resort to a HTML to PDF conversion
step. It may be useful for other purposes as well, but this is the one I'm
reasonably sure works.

# INSTALLATION

Retrieve the source code...

```
git clone https://github.com/jgrassler/mkdocs-pandoc
```

...and add the repository's bin/ directory to your current shell's search
path:

```
PATH=$PATH:$(readlink -e mkdocs-pandoc/bin)
```

Add the result of `echo "PATH=\$PATH:$(readlink -e mkdocs-pandoc/bin)"` to your
shell's initialization file, e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to add the
repository's `bin/` directory to your shell's search path permanently.

# USAGE

When executed in the directory where your documentation's `mkdoc.yml` and the
`docs/` directory containing the actual documentation resides, `mkdocs2pandoc`
should print one long Markdown document suitable for `pandoc(1)` on standard
output. This works under the following assumptions:

1. The commands in this repository's `bin/` directory are in your shell's
   `PATH` variable (if you followed the installation instructions above they
   should be).

2. `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml` is set to `docs` or unset (in this case it
   defaults to `docs`). If your `docs_dir` is set to a different value specify
   it as the first argument to mkdocs2pandoc.

## Usage example

```
cd ~/mydocs
mkdocs2pandoc > mydocs.pd
pandoc --toc -f markdown+grid_tables+table_captions -o mydocs.pdf mydocs.pd   # Generate PDF
pandoc --toc -f markdown+grid_tables -t epub -o mydocs.epub mydocs.pd         # Generate EPUB
```

# BUGS

The following things are known to be broken:

* `mdtableconv.py`: Line wrapping in table cells will wrap links, which causes
  whitespace to be inserted in their target URLs, at least in PDF output. While
  this is a bit of a Pandoc problem,

* `mdtitles.rb`, `mdchapters.rb`, and (indirectly) `mdhead.rb`: these scripts
  use information from the `pages` data structure in `mkdocs.yml` and go about
  it in a rather naive way that breaks with 
  [Multilevel Documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#multilevel-documentation).

* [Internal Hyperlinks](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#internal-hyperlinks) 
  between markdown documents will be reduced to their link titles, i.e. they
  will not be links in the resulting Pandoc document.

# ROADMAP

I plan on turning this mess of scripts into a proper Python module. Stay tuned
and feel free to play with the existing code in the mean time.
